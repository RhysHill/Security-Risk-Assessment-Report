# 🔐 Security Risk Assessment Report: Hardening a Social Media Network

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, I stepped into the role of a cybersecurity analyst at a social media organisation that had just experienced a major data breach. The goal was to assess the organisation’s network security, identify key vulnerabilities, and recommend practical hardening methods to prevent future incidents.

This activity is part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** on Coursera and focuses on applying real-world security practices—analysing threats, making clear recommendations, and communicating findings effectively, just as expected in a professional setting.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Risk Assessment** – Evaluating the organisation’s security posture and prioritising key risks.  
- **Vulnerability Analysis** – Identifying major weaknesses, such as weak password policies and lack of MFA.  
- **Network Hardening** – Recommending security controls like port filtering and strong authentication.  
- **Security Strategy** – Designing long-term, proactive measures to prevent recurring incidents.  
- **Professional Reporting** – Writing structured, easy-to-follow technical documentation.

## 🔍 My Approach

### Reviewing the Breach
The organisation suffered a breach that exposed sensitive customer information. My objective was to recommend measures that could be implemented consistently to prevent similar attacks.

### Identifying the Vulnerabilities
I found four key issues in the current network setup:
- Employees sharing passwords  
- Default admin password still in use  
- No firewall traffic filtering  
- Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Choosing Hardening Methods
Based on these findings, I selected three actionable and effective solutions:
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- Firewall Maintenance & Port Filtering  
- Strong Password Policies

### Explaining the Recommendations
I broke down each method by:
- What it is  
- Why it matters  
- How it directly addresses the vulnerabilities  
- How it prevents future breaches

## ✅ Final Recommendations

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring that even if a password is compromised, access isn’t granted without a second form of verification.

### Firewall Maintenance & Port Filtering
Helps monitor and control incoming/outgoing traffic by closing unnecessary ports and updating rules to block suspicious activity.

### Strong Password Policies
Discourages password sharing and default credentials, enforces secure password creation, and reduces the risk of credential-based attacks.
